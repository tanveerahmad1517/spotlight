# Spotlight

This is a custom tool specially built for journalist's but if your work revolves around creating and writing articles feel free to use it. It's meant to be used for easing your workload and eliminating the dozens of 'post-it's you stick while working on a project.

### App features are listed below:

*Note: I will not maintain this project because I doubt there will ever be an interest. *


## Log In Gate

After logging in you will be welcomed with the dashboard page where you can see all of the announcements made by all of the users of the site. I didn't create a signup page intentionally because the only person who is allowed to create staff users should be the admin.

## Browse Desk's

Each reporter should be assigned to at least one desk because otherwise how can the boss know what are you working on. Think of 'desk's as departments in a newspaper such as 'Metro', 'Investigative Research', 'Global News' .. etc. You can name your desks whatever you want but you have to give it a category for the app to take care of the other features for your desk's.


## To-Do

After joining a desk the first thing you get redirected to is the to-do section of the desk. In this page you can create to-do tasks, mark other peoples to-do tasks as completed or delete the task completely if you want to have a clean to-do page. But remember if you delete one you cannot access to it ever again.

## New Article

At every desk you can create a new article. It does not need a lot of explanation you just type a title and the body of your article in it and the site take cares the rest of the mechanism. You may ask why you can't create an article without having to join a desk and the answer is a little bit tricky. You can create articles without having to join a desk but if you do not the article will not have a category and in that instance your article will not be archived or shown in anywhere in the app. So write your articles in the desk.

## In Progress & Edit Article

After submitting an article you can view your newly created article in the 'in progress' section of the desk. In here you should edit yours and other desk workers articles. Leave comments under their articles for them to see your criticism and change their articles. You should take your time in this 'progress' section and edit the desks articles.
